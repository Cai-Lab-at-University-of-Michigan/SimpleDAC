# SimpleDAC
An open source hardware interface for experimental automation

## Project Layout

This repository is split into two folders:

- [/PCB](/PCB/) contains the KiCAD files used to produce the PCB.
- [/Examples](/Examples/) contains code examples for SimpleDAC firmware.

## Building code examples
All code examples are provided with example CMake files. These can be built by following the [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) install and build instructions.
