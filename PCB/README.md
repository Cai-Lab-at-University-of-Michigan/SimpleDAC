# PCB

In this folder you will find the KiCAD schematics used to produce the SimpleDAC PCB.
The `.kicad_pcb` file can be directly uploaded to a service such as [OshPark](https://oshpark.com/) for printing.
These files were originally designed with KiCAD 6, but have been tested to work with KiCAD 7.
A [Printout](Printout.pdf) is provided for reference.
